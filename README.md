# VICON-vs-MediaPipe
A comparison of joint degrees between the VICON motion capture system and the MediaPipe Model implemented in Python

Abstractâ€”This project aims to compare the performance of two different camera-based approaches to analyze lowerbody joint degrees. The comparison is between the VICON motion-capture system and the computer vision-based
MediaPipe framework implemented in Python. A GUI has been designed to provide physically impaired individuals with
rehabilitation exercises that can be performed from home and exclusively with a smartphone.
