# VICON-vs-MediaPipe

**Abstractâ€”** This project aims to compare the performance of two different camera-based approaches to analyze lowerbody joint degrees. The comparison is between the [VICON](https://www.vicon.com/about-us/what-is-motion-capture/) motion-capture system and the computer vision-based [MediaPipe](https://github.com/google/mediapipe) framework implemented in Python. A GUI has been designed to provide physically impaired individuals with rehabilitation exercises that can be performed from home and exclusively with a smartphone.

## Installation
Download the folder to your preferred directory,
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gcornella/VICON-vs-MediaPipe.git
```
and install the requirements file using the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Execution
Run the main file inside the program folder.
```python
python main.py
```
A GUI will appear automatically, and you will have to choose some inputs that will modify the functionalities of the experiment.
The GUI is designed with [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html), as it can be seen in the file input_selection.py

```python
exercising         # If True, the GUI proposes new knee degrees every time the user pressed the key 'p'
plot_exercise_line # If True, the exercise line is going to be plotted on top of the screen
save               # If True, the program saves an excel file and a .mat file when it finishes executing
udp_open           # If True, the UDP communcation is allowed, and then you just have to run the plotter
```

If you want to plot the knee degrees in a real-time external plotter, allow the UDP communication protocol and run the following file in another session.

```python
python plotter.py
```
